Flourish is a free website to enable everyone to tell strories and visualizaiton with their own data. We have parpare several graph data for users to choose different diffusion networks, including debunking post themes, rumor types and emotions.
Here are three visualizaiton examples of diffusion network. In order to illustrate the diffusion network more clearly, only one post (event) diffusion network is selected for each theme, each rumor type and each emotion. Within the visualization examples, we can view the corresponding type of diffusion network by clicking on different legends.

Here we also prapare the graph data to help users try by themself. Go to the folder you interseted and download the egdes csv file and nodes csv file. Then go to the flourish website, sign in your own account.Next, you can create your own visualization. Select one visualization type, here we select Network graph--Directional. Next, we need to upload our oen data, click the *Data* option, and upload the edges csv file to *Links*, upload the nodes csv file to *points*. Note that remember to delect the first row. After uploaded data, we need to delcare nodes group column and nodes size column. On the right side of the Data--Points webpage, enter B in the group input box (nodes class column name), and enter C in the size input box (nodes size column name). Finally, based on the number of nodes group types, we need to select the number of nodes color in the preview webpage. For examples, here we have six emtoion types, then we select six color to represent six emotions. Note that remember to enable the legend option otherwise we can not see the legend in the preview.
